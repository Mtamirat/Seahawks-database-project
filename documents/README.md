Seahawks-database-project

This Enhanced Entity-Relationship diagram represents a comprehensive database system for Seattle Seahawks team management, designed to serve fans, analysts, team management, media personnel, and fantasy football players. The design centers around 8 core entities with PLAYERS and GAMES as primary entities connected through the PLAYER_STATISTICS associative entity, which resolves the many-to-many relationship between players and games. This approach enables tracking individual player performance across multiple games while maintaining normalized data structure.The primary challenge was balancing normalization with query performance. The solution separates biographical data from performance metrics, reducing redundancy while enabling complex statistical analysis. This design supports both operational needs (roster management, injury tracking) and analytical requirements (performance comparisons, trend analysis) across all identified stakeholder groups.

I designed the Seattle Seahawks database using an 8-table relational structure that directly implements the provided EER diagram specifications, ensuring all table names, column types, and relationships match exactly as specified. I prioritized multi-stakeholder accessibility by implementing a progressive complexity approach where basic users can access simple views like PlayerRoster and GameResults while advanced users can perform complex multi-table analytics joining 4+ tables for comprehensive analysis.

I began the implementation process by creating the MySQL schema using lowercase table names and precise data types as specified in the EER diagram, then imported authentic data from 7 CSV files containing real Seattle Seahawks information from 2022-2024 seasons. I enforced data validation and referential integrity through foreign key constraints, strategic indexing, and validation queries to ensure accuracy across all 160+ records.

I designed intermediate queries such as the home vs away performance analysis that groups games by venue and calculates win percentages, allowing management and media to quickly understand team performance patterns. For example, SELECT home_away, COUNT(*) as games, AVG(seahawks_score) FROM GameResults GROUP BY home_away provides immediate insights into home field advantage.
Steps on how to run SQL scripts on GitHub: Local Development Workflow

I implemented complex multi-table queries that join 4+ tables to meet the advanced analysis requirements, such as my comprehensive player performance query that combines players, player_statistics, games, and stadiums tables to show individual performance in the context of venue and opponent strength. This query serves analysts who need detailed performance breakdowns with environmental factors.

I created specialized business intelligence queries for management decision-making, including injury impact analysis that calculates estimated salary costs and recovery timelines, helping executives make informed roster decisions. My draft success evaluation query joins draft_history, players, player_statistics, and games tables to assess long-term draft pick performance, enabling strategic planning for future drafts.
Finally, I developed user-friendly views like InjuryReport and PlayerStats that encapsulate complex joins into simple interfaces, allowing non-technical stakeholders to access sophisticated analysis through straightforward SELECT statements while maintaining the underlying data integrity and relationships.
